## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#5885AF) to convey stability, trust, and professionalism within the construction industry.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, providing a clean and modern backdrop that complements the blue tones.
- Accent color: Light cyan (#7EC8E3), used sparingly for interactive elements and calls to action, adding a touch of energy without overwhelming the overall calm aesthetic.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. Its neutral and modern appearance is appropriate for a professional services website.
- Clean, grid-based layout with plenty of white space to ensure readability and focus on content.
- Subtle fade-in animations and smooth transitions on page load and content reveal, similar to the reference site, to enhance user engagement.
